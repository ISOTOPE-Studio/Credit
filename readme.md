# Credit

- /credit add [username] [itemID] [amountOfCredits] 

    // I would like this command to allow for me to add credits for specific items in game based on what items I choose to restrict. 
    A way for certain pex groups/op's to be able to bypass the limiter
    
- /credit remove [username] [itemID] [amountofCredits] 

    // In case for some reason that I need to remove credits from a player by username / Item ID

- /credit [user] // Have this where I can view the amount of credits that a player has for each item that is restricted in the config

    i.e. if in the config it is restricting item id's 126:2 and 126:1 then I want it to show
